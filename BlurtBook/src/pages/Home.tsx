        <h2> What is BlurtBook? </h2> 
        <p> BlurtBook is an AI assisted studying tool that is based on blurting out your notes to memorize them</p>
        <br></br>
        <h2> What is "Blurting"?</h2>
        <p> Blurting your notes means to review them for some amount of time, and then without looking at them, write out everything you remember about your notes. By doing this, you require yourself to recall the information and then better remember the topics.</p>
        <p> Although studying is typically better done with pencil and paper, using a computer specifically for blurting makes the process faster and can show you what details you missed and you need focus on more efficiently than blurting your notes physically</p>
        <br></br>
        <h2> How does AI help?</h2>
        <p> Using the ChatGPT API, BlurtBook can produce quizzes and feedback from your notes and blurts. </p>
